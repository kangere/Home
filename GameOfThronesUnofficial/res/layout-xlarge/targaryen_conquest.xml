            android:text="The Targaryens fled Valyria after Daenys Targaryen had a prophetic vision of the Doom. Her father, Aenar, led an exodus to Dragonstone (which had been a Valyrian outpost for two centuries at that time). The prophecy was proved correct when the Doom took place, twelve years later.

A century later, Aegon the Conqueror (born 27 years before the Conquest) began making his plans. He visited Westeros in secret and gathered intelligence on the loyalties and divisions between the noble houses. However, the war actually began due to an act of hostility by the Storm King. Argilac Durrandon proposed an alliance with Aegon against the ironborn, as he feared that once Harren Hoare had completed Harrenhal he would invade the Stormlands. Argilac proposed marrying his daughter, Argella (not Argalia, a name invented for the TV series by Bryan Cogman), to Aegon to cement the deal. Aegon, already married (twice over), instead suggested that Argella marry his half-brother Orys. Argilac, furious had Aegon&apos;s envoy&apos;s hands cut off and sent back to him, saying those were the only hands a bastard could expect of him.

Aegon sent ravens to the rulers of the Seven Kingdoms, demanding their loyalty and threatening them with destruction. Sharra Arryn, Queen-Regent of the Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale, instead offered a mutual alliance on the condition that Aegon marry her and make her son, the infant King Ronnel Arryn, his heir. Princess Mariya Martell of Dorne offered a military alliance aimed at destroying the Storm King, but nothing more. Aegon ignored both offers.

Aegon&apos;s army of less than 3,000 troops landed at the mouth of the Blackwater, where he declared himself King of the Seven Kingdoms. In a rapid campaign of movement, his forces quickly captured Rosby, Stokeworth, Duskendale and Maidenpool. He then split his forces in three: the Targaryen fleet commanded by Daemon Velaryon would sail north, escorted by Visenya and her dragon, to land at Gulltown and begin the conquest of the Vale. Orys and Rhaenys would lead an army south to deal with Argilac. Aegon himself would march on Harrenhal.

The Targaryen fleet was intercepted by the Arryn fleet out of Gulltown and a furious sea battle took place. The Targaryen fleet was destroyed, but Visenya was able to burn most of the Arryn fleet in retaliation, resulting in a mutual defeat.

Aegon&apos;s invasion of the Riverlands was spearheaded by him on dragonback, burning the ironborn longships on the rivers and on Gods Eye (and killing several of Harren&apos;s sons). Impressed, Lord Edmyn Tully of Riverrun led a popular uprising against the ironbron. Houses Tully, Bracken, Blackwood, Mallister and Frey marched on Harrenhal and joined forces with Aegon. However, even this alliance only gave him 8,000 troops, far too few to take the castle. Harren insulted Aegon and refused to surrender. Aegon burned the castle with Balerion, killing Harren. The ironborn surrendered.

Hearing of Harren&apos;s fate, Argilac refused to be slaughtered like an animal and instead chose to give open battle. When a massive thunderstorm erupted as the armies assembled, Argilac took it as a sign and attacked. Outnumbering the Targaryen host 2-1, Argilac&apos;s forces gained the upper hand and outflanked Orys&apos;s forces. However, Rhaenys and her dragon Meraxes entered the fray, destroying part of Argilac&apos;s army whilst Orys engaged Argilac in personal combat and slew him. Argella declared herself the Storm Queen and tried to fight on, but her own bannermen betrayed her and handed her over to Orys. Orys treated her with kindness and accepted the surrender of Storm&apos;s End.

The Lannisters and Gardeners marched against Aegon&apos;s forces. Aegon regrouped with his sister-wives at Stoney Sept before marching south to the Reach. They destroyed the Host of the Two Kings on the Field of Fire and accepted the surrender of their bannermen. Aegon meant to press on to Dorne with his combined host, but then learned that King Torrhen Stark and 30,000 northmen were marching south. He rushed north to meet them at the Trident. Torrhen had planned to give battle, even entertaining a plan put forward by his bastard half-brother Brandon Snow to assassinate the dragons through stealth, but upon seeing Aegon&apos;s vaster numbers and dragons he knew he could not subject Westeros to another field of fire. He sent three maesters to negotiate a surrender and then knelt before Aegon, who named him Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

The Arryns had also assembled a mighty host at the Bloody Gate and were preparing for war. However, choosing a different tactic, Visenya flew her dragon straight into the courtyard of the Eyrie, where the young boy-king Ronnel was playing. When his mother came out of the castle, she found that Visenya had already negotiated the surrender of House Arryn with Ronnel in return for being given a ride on her dragon. The Arryns also bent the knee to Aegon.

Rhaenys led an army into Dorne, only to find the holdfasts empty and the armies of Dorne scattered into small bands which constantly harassed her supply lines. Frustrated, she flew to Sunspear to confront Princess Mariya Martell, the so-called Yellow Toad of Dorne. Mariya, eighty years old, blind and almost bald, defied Rhaenys to her face, telling her that Dorne would never surrender. Fearing that the cost of taking Dorne would be ruinous, Aegon agreed to allow it to remain independent.

Aegon triumphantly entered Oldtown and was proclaimed King of Westeros, ending the War of Conquest after two years."
