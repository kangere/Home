The White Walkers reanimated the dead as Wights to kill the living at their command, and soon the White Walkers led their hordes of undead to sweep across the continent.

Eventually the First Men and the Children of the Forest rallied to defend themselves and in a conflict known as the War for the Dawn, the White Walkers were defeated and driven back into the uttermost north.

The Wall was constructed along the northernmost isthmus of northern Westeros to bar their return, a massive fortification standing seven hundred feet high and stretching from one side of the continent to the other. Legend says that the Wall was infused with powerful magic spells by the Children of the Forest that prevent the White Walkers from crossing it. The order of the Night&apos;s Watch was founded to defend the Wall.\n"

Even the few who believe they did once exist think they went extinct thousands of years ago. Certainly, none was seen for the next eight thousand years between their supposed defeat and the time of Robert&apos;s Rebellion.


As the War of the Five Kings begins, disturbing reports have come back from the scouts of the Night&apos;s Watch that for reasons as yet unknown, the White Walkers have begun to return. Given that the great lords of Westeros are short-sightedly more concerned with fighting each other for control of the realm, most have simply ignored the warnings of the Night&apos;s Watch, to focus on their civil war. This leaves only the under-supported and under-manned Night&apos;s Watch to stand between the White Walkers and the realms of men."
